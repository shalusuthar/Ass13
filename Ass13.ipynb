    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pace of development with NoSQL databases can be much faster than with a SQL database. Because NoSQL databases often allow developers to be in control of the structure of the data, they are a good fit with modern Agile development practices based on sprints, quick iterations, and frequent code pushes.\n"
